## Introduction
Online shopping is trending these days as it provides many benefits like convenience, large selection of products, great prices and so on. Inspite of these benefits, shopping clothes online is still tricky because it's difficult to gauge their fit as every brand has slightly different sizing convention. Thus, recommending appropriate catalog sizes of clothing products is critical for improving online clothing shopping experience and reducing return rates. In this post, first we frame the catalog size recommendation problem, then deep dive into the challenges of recommending catalog sizes that fit and then finally elaborate a Machine Learning model that tries to address those challenges to provide better recommendations.

## Background

## Challenges
* Customers' fit feedback reflects not only the objective match/mismatch between a product's true size and a customer's measurements, but also depends on other subjective characteristics of a product's style and properties.
* Customers' fit feedback is unevenly distributed as most transactions are reported as "fit".
