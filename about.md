I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I am currently a second year Masters student at the University of California San Diego specializing in Machine Learning. 

My research interest is in the area of Recommender Systems since the time I was involved in the development of scalable models for recommender systems at IIT Madras. Currently, I'm involved in research projects under the guidance of Prof. Julian McAuley and his Ph.D. student Mengting Wan. These projects are related to review recommendation and entail applying NLP techniques to understand the review text and designing scalable recommender system models to provide the recommendation. 

Apart from this, I'm currently interning at Amazon where my project is to bring the support of primary key constraint, batch inserts/updates, transactions, and compaction in Hive while ensuring read consistency. Previously I worked with Arcesium India, a recently formed subsidiary of D.E. Shaw & Co, as a software developer. I was responsible for revamping their infrastructure to make it more scalable and robust. 

My work experience has helped me in understanding the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software and my research experience is providing me in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning field.
