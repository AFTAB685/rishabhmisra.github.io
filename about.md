I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I am currently a second year Masters student at the University of California San Diego specializing in Machine Learning. 

My research interests are in the areas of Recommender Systems and Data Mining. I got my first exposure to these areas during my intern at IIT Madras where I was involved in the development of scalable Bayesian models for rating prediction task. Currently, I'm involved in research projects under the guidance of Prof. Julian McAuley. These projects entail uncovering interesting and practical insights on some novel datasets which we obtained and designing models to aid the prediction tasks. 

Apart from this, I interned at Amazon in Summer 2017 where my project was to bring the support of primary key constraint, batch inserts/updates, transactions, and compaction in Hive while ensuring read consistency. Previously I worked with Arcesium India, a recently formed subsidiary of D.E. Shaw & Co, as a software developer. I was responsible for revamping their infrastructure to make it more scalable and robust. 

My work experience has helped me in understanding the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software and my research experience is providing me in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning field.
