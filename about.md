I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I am currently a second year Masters student at the University of California San Diego specializing in Machine Learning. 

My research interests are in the areas of Recommender Systems and Data Mining. I got my first exposure to these areas during my intern at IIT Madras where I was involved in the development of scalable Bayesian models for rating prediction task. 

Currently, I'm working on several research projects under the guidance of Prof. Julian McAuley. Recently, I submitted a paper in RecSys'18 based on a project related to recommending appropriate clothing product sizes to customers. The proposed approach improves upon a method proposed by Amazon by up to 18%. Other projects entail uncovering interesting and practical insights on some novel datasets obtained by us and designing models to aid the prediction tasks. 

Apart from this, I interned at Amazon in Summer'17 where my project was to bring the support of primary key constraint, batch inserts/updates, transactions, and compaction in Hive while ensuring read consistency. This was particularly challenging as Hive is not designed to handle transactional data and operations. Previously, I also worked with Arcesium, a recently formed subsidiary of D.E. Shaw & Co, as a software developer. I was responsible for revamping their infrastructure to make it more scalable and robust. 

My work experience has helped me in understanding the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software and my research experience is providing me in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning field.
