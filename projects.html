                        Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customers’ fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets collected from online clothing retailers.

                        In this work, we first implement and then propose an extension to the paper Jointly Modeling Aspects, Ratings and Sentiments for movie recommendation (JMARS) by carefully incorporating temporal dynamics into the model and empirically showing that it provides an improvement of around 0.9% on two datasets. We replicate the quantitative results and qualitative analysis provided in the original paper and furthermore, provide some analysis from the extended model.

                        Sarcasm Detection has enjoyed great interest from the research community, however the task of predicting sarcasm in a text remains an elusive problem for machines. Past studies mostly make use of twitter datasets collected using hashtag based supervision but such datasets are noisy in terms of labels and language. To overcome these shortcoming, we introduce a new dataset which contains news headlines from a sarcastic news website and a real news website. Next, we propose a hybrid Neural Network architecture with attention mechanism which provides insights about what actually makes sentences sarcastic. Through experiments, we show that the proposed model improves upon the baseline by ∼ 5% in terms of classification accuracy.
